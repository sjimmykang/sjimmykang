# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hello, I'm Jimmy Kang, a dedicated front-end web developer based in Toronto, ON.<br><br>I've been dedicating my recent time on honing my coding skills. And although I make silly coding mistakes along the way, I love get down to the root cause of the problem to fix them and learn from my mistakes.
<br><br>
Currently looking for Frontend Web Developer role in tech. 
<br><br>
In my spare time, I like to read fantasy novels or play video game while drinking hot tea in the comfort of my room.
<br><br>
Feel free to reach out!
